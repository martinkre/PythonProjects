# These are some Python Projects

I made an app in python were you can add attendees to a database. You can choose different databases and fill it. Start main.py and type help for a list of commands

everyone gets a unique ID and you can list all the attendees. There is an autofill function that will add a number of your choosing as John Does to the database. You can delete attendees when entering their position of the list as well as delete the whole list.

The reason for these projects is my university study. I wanted to combine everything I learned into a single program. There is no real purpose to it.
My focus was an intro to DevSecOps, Database attachment with sqlite, using classes and different namespaces in python and creating and interactive cli.

The second folder includes some opencv apps I wanted to play with.
